## Teaching

I teach at a master's and bachelor's level on sustainability and innovation topics at the Department of Economic History, Lund University.

To help students and practitioners gain a deeper understanding of innovation systems, I have designed a teaching game to simulate an innovation system.
Participants allocate resources, negotiate research goals and discover innovations, while balancing collective and individual goals.
It is available for free and open source: [Innovation Systems for Sustainability](https://pjkreutzer.github.io/innovation-systems-game/).
