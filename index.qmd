I am a PhD student in Economic History at Lund University. My PhD research focuses on environmental innovation, especially in the Swedish forest industry. Primarily, I am examining what role innovation can play in reducing emissions and conserving biodiversity.
Another focus is on understanding how and why people innovate for the environment and under what circumstances innovations are successful in the long run.

The project is supervised by Josef Taalbi and Astrid Kander and is embedded in the research project SWINNO 3.0: Significant new products and processes in Sweden
1970 to present, financed by VINNOVA (Sweden’s Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems).
