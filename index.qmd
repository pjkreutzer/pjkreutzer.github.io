:::{#about}
I am a PhD student in Economic History at Lund University. I research the transition to a bioeconomy in the Swedish forest sector.

The project is supervised by Josef Taalbi and Astrid Kander and is embedded in the research project SWINNO 3.0: Significant new products and processes in Sweden
1970 to present, financed by VINNOVA (Swedenâ€™s Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems).
