Together with other PhD students at Lund University, I organized a workshop to bridge social sciences with social activists.
We had a great day of discussions and insightful presentations.

# for organizations 
Building and improving organizations is tough, especially if resources are limited.
For almost ten years, I have worked in and for organizations on topics ranging from improving daily operations to long term strategy.

If you are a non-profit, student, social or other type of organization that tries to contribute to a better society, please feel free to get in touch!

# for schools

I have talked to various classes of high school students about economic history, innovation and sustainability.

If you are a teacher or student and would like to have a chat, you are very welcome to reach out!
