# For Organizations

Building and improving organizations is tough, especially if resources are limited.
For almost ten years, I have worked in and for organizations on topics ranging from improving daily operations to long term strategy.

If you are a non-profit, student, social or other type of organization that tries to contribute to a better society, please feel free to get in touch!

# For High Schools

I have talked to various classes of high school students about economic history, innovation and sustainability.

If you are a teacher or student and would like to have a chat, you are very welcome to reach out!
