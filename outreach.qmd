# for researchers

Together with other PhD students at Lund University, I am organizing a workshop to bridge social sciences with social activists.
If you are interested in contributing, you can find more information [here](pjkreutzer.github.io/social-change-workshop).

# for organizations

Building and improving organizations is tough, especially if resources are limited.
For almost ten years, I have worked in and for organizations on topics ranging from improving daily operations to long term strategy.

If you are a non-profit, student, social or other type of organization that tries to contribute to a better society, please feel free to get in touch!

# for schools

I have talked to various classes of high school students about economic history, innovation and sustainability.

If you are a teacher or student and would like to have a chat, you are very welcome to reach out!
