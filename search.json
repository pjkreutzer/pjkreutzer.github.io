In my PhD project, I investigate the directionality of transitioning to bioeconomies.\nThe Swedish forestry sector makes for a great case study, as it is at the national and international forefront of transitions to a bioeconomy. I use SWINNO data to understand which vision of a bioeconomy (technological, resource, or ecology) the forest sector worked towards from 1970 onward.\nTogether with an evaluation of the effects of these significant innovations, the first part of my thesis therefore analyzes which shade of green the bioeconomy transition takes on.\nIn the second part of my thesis, I dig deeper into the innovation system of the forest sector. By analyzing the networks of innovators within the sector, I research how exactly the transition to a bioeconomy spreads and if technological lock-ins to any single vision exist.\nWant to know more about my research plans?
