I teach at a master's and bachelor's level on sustainability and innovation topics at the Department of Economic History, Lund University.

To help students and practicionairs gain a deeper understanding of innovation systems, I have designed a teaching game to simulate an innovation systems.
Participants need to allocate resources, negotiate research goals and discover innovations, while balancing collective and individual goals.
It is available for free and open source: [Innovation Systems for Sustainability](https://pjkreutzer.github.io/innovation-systems-game/).
